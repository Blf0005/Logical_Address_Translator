## Logical Address Translator

This program performs a logical address translation from a CPU generated logical address to a corresponding physical address. 
The program will require a user input of the page size and the CPU generated logical address and will then generate the correct page number. The user will then look up the page number in the page table and enter the frame contents in Hexadecimal. The program uses this information to determine the Physical address of the process.
